# Import Tests From Source Code

## Why do I need to Import my tests?

Automated tests are hidden within the code and this gem is seen only to engineers. While they play an important role in product management they are not available to the whole team. To bring visibility of current tests and show what pieces of software are covered you can bring your tests into Testomatio. 
Also, when you have dozens of tests you may get lost in it. You may need to search around features and to map them with specifications or Jira tickets. When automated tests are imported in Testomatio you can search around tests, plan new test cases, receive reports, and more!
