# Import Tests

Testomat.io can import automated tests into a project.
We provide CLI tools for different frameworks so you get visibility of your tests in seconds.
On this page we collect the reference to them. Learn how to install and configure test importer for your project.

## JavaScript

> ðŸ“‘ This documentation is taken from open-source project [testomatio/check-tests](https://github.com/testomatio/check-tests)


Use this checker as CLI tool with any Continuous Integration service.

Run `check-tests` via npx:

```sh
npx check-tests <framework> "<tests>" --no-skipped
```

### Development

To change host of endpoint for receiving data, and set it to other than app.testomat.io use TESTOMATIO_URL environment variable:

TESTOMATIO_URL=http://local.testomat.io


> This checker will fail a build if exclusive tests (with `.only` or `fit` or `fdescribe` found)

### Arguments:

* test framework
* glob pattern to match tests in a project, example: `tests/**_test.js'`. **It is important to include glob pattern in double quotes `"` so wildcard could be used correctly.**

### CLI Options:

* `--no-skipped` - fail when skipped tests found
* `--typescript` - enable typescript support
* `-g, --generate-file <fileName>` - Export test details to document
* `-u, --url <url>`, Github URL to get file link (URL/tree/master)

### Example

To generate test document
```
check-tests mocha "tests/*_test.js" -g Test-doc.md -u https://github.com/testomatio/check-tests/tree/master
```

Check tests for CodeceptJS

```
npx check-tests codeceptjs "tests/**_test.js"
```

Check tests for Protractor

```
npx check-tests protractor "spec/**.spec.js"
```

Check tests for Protractor with TypeScript

```
npx check-tests protractor "spec/**.spec.ts" --typescript
```

Check tests for Cypress.io

```
npx check-tests cypress "cypress/integration/**.js"
```

Check tests for Testcafe

```
npx check-tests testcafe "tests/**.js"
```

### Sample Output

List CodeceptJS tests

When found `.only` test:

```
âœ— npx check-tests mocha "test/**/**_test.js"

[[ Tests checker by testomat.io ]]
Error: Exclusive tests detected. `.only` call found in test/checkout/important_test.js:290
Remove `.only` to restore test checks

```

## Using in Testomatio

This library is used by [Testomatio](https://testomat.io) to import tests.

## Importing Into Project

Use `TESTOMATIO` environment variable with a valid API key to import data into a project.
API key can be obtained on project settings page or on "Import From Source" page.

For example:

```
TESTOMATIO=11111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"

```

### Import Into a Specific Suite

To put all imported tests into a specific suite (folder) pass in `TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR` environment variable:

```
TESTOMATIO_PREPEND_DIR="MyTESTS" TESTOMATIO=1111111 npx check-tests CodeceptJS "**/*{.,_}{test,spec}.js"
```

## TypeScript

For TypeScript projects `@babel/core` and `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` packages are used. GitHub Action already contains those modules, while CLI version of this tool tries to automatically install them on first run.

If you face issues parsing TypeScript file menitioning `@babel/core` or `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` try to install them manually:

```
npm i @babel/core @babel/plugin-transform-typescript --save-dev
```

## Limitations

* Can't analyze included tests from external files
* Can't analyze dynamically created tests

## PHP

> ðŸ“‘ This documentation is taken from open-source project [testomatio/php-list-tests](https://github.com/testomatio/php-list-tests)


This CLI utility prints all tests in PHP project **without executing them**.
Easily check the number tests and get live documentation for your tests in markdown format!

> Supports PHPUnit & Codeception.

This CLI script is also used to import tests into Testomat.io application.

## Installation

```
composer require testomatio/list-tests --dev
```

## Usage

To print all tests execute `list-tests` script pointing to directory with tests:

```
php vendor/bin/list-tests test/
```

This will print output similar to this: 

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ee5PXDOWkAEdiyz?format=jpg&name=large)

To print tests into a file execute command with `--markdown` option providing a filename to save info into:

```
php vendor/bin/list-tests tests --markdown test-docs.md
```

This command will save test list into "tests.md" file.

To show test list with links to corresponding files on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket 
use `PREPEND_URL` environment variable and set a base URL for tests files.

```
PREPEND_URL=https://github.com/testomatio/php-list-tests/tests php vendor/bin/list-tests tests --markdown tests.md 
```

This will generate a file similar to [test-docs.md](test-docs.md) in this repository.

## Import into [Testomat.io](https://testomat.io)

This script can also import tests from PHP project into the testomat.io project.
Pass in TESTOMATIO API KEY of your project to import tests:

```
TESTOMATIO={api-key} php vendor/bin/list-tests tests 
```
