Testomat.io Team implemented Companies feature to simplify work with your team and subscriptions.
Now your projects are stored in Companies. Each user may have one company, so you will not shuffle your projects with others.

On the Companies page, you have a list of companies you participate in with mentioning your role in them.

## Roles Within a Company

Testomat.io provides different roles within projects and companies to make your testing process more convenient.
Different team members have different access levels to management options:

- **Owner** is a team member who created a company, can purchase a subscription, can invite members to a company and a project, create projects, and has access to all features within the project
- **Manager** is a team member who can purchase a subscription, can create projects, invite members to a company and a project, and has access to all features within the project
- **Developer** is a team member who can create projects and has access to all features within the project
- **Billing** is a team member who can update subscriptions and is free.
- **Read-only** is a team member who has permissions for viewing or reading information, can't make changes and is free (available in Professional and Enterprise plans).

## Teams 

You need to manage project access for some user groups. With this feature, you can import all users of one project into another. Namely, you can group users into different **teams** to add them to different projects.

## Billing User

The billing user is meant to access to the billing and account management features, allowing them to update payment methods, manage subscriptions, or modify billing details. They are typically the primary point of contact for any billing-related inquiries or issues.

Our system allows the addition of billing users for free, it means that multiple individuals or entities can be designated as billing users without incurring any additional charges specifically for that role. This can be advantageous for businesses or organizations that require multiple people to manage the billing and financial aspects of their accounts.

**How to add a Billing user**

There are 2 ways to add a Billing user:

1. You can invite the Billing user to your company

![billing1](https://github.com/testomatio/docs/assets/77803888/db746e2e-6f4d-4285-ac42-1611c1c58475)


2. You can make existing user Billing

**How to add a Billing user for Free**

If you want to use Billing users for free add them as Read-only users. See how it works [here](https://docs.testomat.io/subscriptions/companies/#read-only-users).








## Project Archive 

There may be completed projects that are not being developed or paused for some reason. So you may need to **archive** such projects not to mix up current work. In this case the archived project is placed on the Archive page, so it can be easily restored.
