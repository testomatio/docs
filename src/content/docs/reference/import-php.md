> ðŸ“‘ This documentation is taken from open-source project [testomatio/php-list-tests](https://github.com/testomatio/php-list-tests)


This CLI utility prints all tests in PHP project **without executing them**.
Easily check the number tests and get live documentation for your tests in markdown format!

> Supports PHPUnit & Codeception.

This CLI script is also used to import tests into Testomat.io application.

### Installation

```
composer require testomatio/list-tests --dev
```

### Usage

To print all tests execute `list-tests` script pointing to directory with tests:

```
php vendor/bin/list-tests test/
```

This will print output similar to this:

To print tests into a file execute command with `--markdown` option providing a filename to save info into:

```
php vendor/bin/list-tests tests --markdown test-docs.md
```

This command will save test list into "tests.md" file.

To show test list with links to corresponding files on GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket 
use `PREPEND_URL` environment variable and set a base URL for tests files.

```
PREPEND_URL=https://github.com/testomatio/php-list-tests/tests php vendor/bin/list-tests tests --markdown tests.md 
```

This will generate a file similar to [test-docs.md](test-docs.md) in this repository.

### Import into [Testomat.io](https://testomat.io)

This script can also import tests from PHP project into the testomat.io project.
Pass in TESTOMATIO API KEY of your project to import tests:

```
TESTOMATIO={api-key} php vendor/bin/list-tests tests 
```
