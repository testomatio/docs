## Connecting to JIRA project

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!"> Please note connecting to JIRA project requires admin rights to enable two-way integration capabilities like editing test cases or executing tests directly in JIRA. So user that is used to make JIRA configuration on project settings should have JIRA admin rights otherwise Testomat.io project won't possible to connect to JIRA.
</Aside>

To link tests to JIRA issues connect a Testomatio project to JIRA project.

## Linking Test to JIRA Issue

To link a test to an issue, open a test in a Testomatio project that previously was connected to JIRA project. Select "Attach Jira Issue" in the dots menu.

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 24 14@2x](./images/191559194-3e330a81-d98c-4f24-8978-e64632ae68ef.jpg)

When attaching a test to an issue you can either link to an existing issue or create a new one.

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 26 51@2x](./images/191559583-504e867b-185a-4672-94d9-53ae6813a514.jpg)

This test will be displayed in Jira under the Issue view:

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 34 33@2x](./images/191561367-9e4be6fc-2f06-414d-a590-5ae85ee2d26b.jpg)

Please note, that you can link a test to multiple issues. In this case their IDs will be displayed in test view in Testomatio:

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 28 55@2x](./images/191560321-46482505-4509-454a-a633-a7be87816520.jpg)

## Linking Suite to JIRA Issue

A suite can be attached to a JIRA issue similarly to a test. When attaching a suite, **all tests inside that suite will be linked to a JIRA issue** (this doesn't include tests from sub-suites). 

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 36 25@2x](./images/191562188-4192ca13-e0ca-429b-815b-b0ffd680ec57.jpg)

If your tests from the linked Suite are not shown in the Jira issue, click on the menu-button and on "Testomatio"

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 40 19@2x](./images/191562634-894acdb6-9316-4427-9185-e0bd34e3aa83.jpg)

Now tests from added Suite are shown in the Jira issue:

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 44 06@2x](./images/191563321-14208936-0c61-4886-882a-7b7db081e9fb.jpg)

If you unlink an issue from a suite, all tests of this suite will be unlinked as well.

## Creating JIRA Issue for a Failed Run

To create a JIRA Issue for a failed manual or automated run open a run and select "Attach Jira Issue" in the dots menu: 

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 47 04@2x](./images/191564154-6c2e4552-3631-4cbe-8590-6ac1185125e9.jpg)

Create a new issue for a run or attach it to an existing issue.

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 52 02@2x](./images/191564967-ca138d17-9ddd-4b82-bd37-7f9e6a9cc7d8.jpg)

## Creating JIRA Issue for a Failed Test

You will be able to create a new issue for this test or link it to existing issue.

![CleanShot 2022-09-21 at 19 55 09@2x](./images/191565572-b502c38c-8c0e-498c-8bad-d6a1211834fd.jpg)
