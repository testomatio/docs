## How To Manage Team Members Within a Company 

How To Increase And Decrease Amount Of Team Members
You can change the number of seats in your team account at any time.

Your seat count can be adjusted in the Companies section. The number of seats in your account determines the amount youâ€™re billed upon subscription renewal as well as the maximum number of people who can be active in your account.

If you want to reduce the amount youâ€™re charged, youâ€™ll need to first delete people under Company Team Members and then reduce your seat count by taking the steps below. Along the same lines, you may need to increase your seat count before youâ€™re able to invite more people to your Testomat.io account. Note that a reduced amount of seats will apply with the next subscription payment.

1. Go to the Companies tab on a dashboard and click the Edit button
