# Trials

Testomat.io provides two trials for you to evaluate all features: a 30 Days Trial and an additional extra 14 Days Trial, which you can use after the 30 Days Trial ends if you need more time to make a decision.

## Free 30 Days Trial

All new users are given a free trial to evaluate Testomat.io features without a commitment. The free trial period allows getting familiar with our features and benefits of delivery with simplified test management using out-of-the-box test automation integration capabilities.

## Extra Free 14 Days Trial

**Duration**
An extra free trial lasts for 14 days from the moment of its activation. It is available only once per user registration. It may be picked after the ending 30 days trial at any time. It may be postponed, but it can't be paused. 

## When Trial Ends

Please note, when the Free Trial ends features over the Free plan limit will no longer be available. However, their data is not lost. If you subscribe to a Professional or Enterprise plan, you will be able to access those features and content again.
