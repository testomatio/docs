# GDPR Commitment

Testomat.io, or just Testomat, is really serious about following the GDPR rules that started on May 25, 2018. GDPR is a big deal because it helps protect people’s data in Europe. Testomat has to follow these rules because it works with people in Europe.

We want our users to know that we’re doing everything we can to follow these rules. If you have questions or worries about this, you can email our legal team at [contact page](/contact-us/contact-us).

## Common Questions about GDPR

#### 1. **Do we have to keep data in Europe?**
No! GDPR doesn’t say that data has to stay in Europe, but it does need to be looked after properly if it leaves Europe. 

#### 2. **What’s a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?**
It’s a special agreement that talks about how we handle and look after the data you give us. It’s part of Privacy Policy.

#### 3. **Does GDPR affect companies outside of Europe?**
Yes! Any company, anywhere, has to follow GDPR if they’re dealing with people in Europe.

#### 4. **Do we need permission to handle people’s data?**
Yes, but there are other reasons we can use too, like if we have a legal reason, or if we have a contract with the person.

#### 5. **What’s the difference between a “data controller” and a “data processor”?**
A Data Controller decides how to use the data (like Testomat’s customers), and a Data Processor (like Testomat) uses the data as the controller wants.

#### 6. **Who helps Testomat with processing data?**

#### 9. **Does all data have to be encrypted?**
No, GDPR asks companies to protect data properly, but it doesn’t say exactly how, like saying it has to be encrypted.
