## Common Questions about GDPR

#### 1. **Do we have to keep data in Europe?**
No! GDPR doesn’t say that data has to stay in Europe, but it does need to be looked after properly if it leaves Europe. 

#### 2. **What’s a Data Processing Agreement (DPA)?**
It’s a special agreement that talks about how we handle and look after the data you give us. It’s part of Privacy Policy.

#### 3. **Does GDPR affect companies outside of Europe?**
Yes! Any company, anywhere, has to follow GDPR if they’re dealing with people in Europe.

#### 4. **Do we need permission to handle people’s data?**
Yes, but there are other reasons we can use too, like if we have a legal reason, or if we have a contract with the person.

#### 5. **What’s the difference between a “data controller” and a “data processor”?**
A Data Controller decides how to use the data (like Testomat’s customers), and a Data Processor (like Testomat) uses the data as the controller wants.
