## Overview
Testomat.ioâ€™s JIRA plugin is designed to enhance the integration between your testing environment and your JIRA projects. It accesses your JIRA projects to show tests that can be attached to any issue in JIRA, providing a seamless way to link your test suites with your project issues. Below is a detailed overview of the permissions required by Testomat.io and the scope of access within your JIRA projects.

## Permissions and Access Scope
- **Read Access:** Testomat.io has read access to all issues of a project it is enabled on. This is essential to fetch relevant details and display tests that can be attached to any issue in JIRA.
- **Write Properties:** Testomat.io can write properties to save tests data into JIRA storage attached to a specific issue. This is the only write operation performed by Testomat.io.
- **No Update or Delete Operations:** Testomat.io does not update or delete any issues on your JIRA. It strictly adheres to read and write properties operations to ensure the integrity of your JIRA issues.

## API Endpoints Accessed
